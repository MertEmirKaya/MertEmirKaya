Hi, I'm @MertEmirKaya, I'm living in Turkey, I've been studying Computer Engineering(Computer Science) at KARADENIZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY and  I'm a first grade. I'm interested in web development and artificial intelligence. I've got a web development project and I am going to be a back-end developer on this project so I'm learning Django and its Rest Framework. Also, I have attended a course about data science which is given by Google so I'm learning TensorFlow.
